# RideNet
### Overview
This project explores the use of **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** and related technologies to analyze spatial and other types of data to make **routing** and **ride-hailing matching** decisions. The model can be accessed and utilized via a **RESTful API**.

### Project Goals
- Use **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for route optimization and ride-hailing matching.
- Analyze **spatial** and **time-series** data to improve the efficiency of passenger-driver matching.

### Key Technologies
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for spatial data analysis
- **Python**, **Flask/FastAPI**, **PyTorch**
- **Geospatial Data** (e.g., OpenStreetMap or other ride data)
- **Ride-Hailing Datasets** (simulated or public data)

### Features
- API-based access to the GNN model for real-time ride-hailing matching.
- Spatial data analysis to optimize routing and passenger-driver assignments.
